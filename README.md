# Overview

### Design

This the overview of how micro-services in the stack we're going to bring up, are connected and interact with each other :

### Networking 

Subnet: `172.25.0.0/16`

- **Between client and ISP router**

  - range: `172.25.0.0/24`
  - network name: `client_side`

Hosts:

| Host | IP |
|---|---|
| ISP Router | 172.25.0.1 |
| Client | 172.25.0.2 |


- **Between the ISP router and Edge router**

  - range: `172.25.1.0/24`
  - network name: `bgp_side`

Hosts:

| Host | IP |
|---|---|
| Edge Server | 172.25.1.1 |
| ISP Router | 172.25.1.2 |



- **Between the Edge router, webserver, and logger**


  - range: `172.25.2.0/24`
  - network name: `server_side`

Hosts:

| Host | IP |
|---|---|
| Edge Server | 172.25.2.1 |
| nginx-reverse-proxy | 172.25.2.2 |
| es01(elasticsearch) | 172.25.2.3 |
| es02(elasticsearch) | 172.25.2.4 |
| kib01 (kibana) | 172.25.2.5 |
| prometheus | 172.25.2.6 |
| fb01 | 172.25.2.7 |
| fb02 | 172.25.2.8 |

# Setup

### Requirements
- The initial setup requires your environment to already have docker engine installed. [install docker for ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

- Since this is a lab project, Please set this up with `root` access so you wouldn't face unexpected problems.

- The most resource-greedy part of this project is the `ELK` stack. although for being more resource-frindly we're installing an older version of `7.14.0`. But it is still greedy! so it is recommended to have at least 4GB of RAM on your machine.

- **Make sure** you have a **secure VPN connection** since `ELK` has buckled up on all those sanctions. It is also recommended to have run `docker login` so you wouldn't face any issue during the image pulling process.


### Initial Setup

There's a script which will do all the setup work for you.
You just need to run the following commands with `root`:

~~~
cd /root/
git clone git@github.com:mohsenkamini/DG-CDN-task.git
cd ./DG-CDN-task/
./setup.sh
~~~

- This script basically:

  - Installs `docker-compsoe` utility 
  - Creates docker networks
  - pulls docker images
  - Runs docker containers and configure them if needed

### Put It to Test (Automated)

To test the functionality of the stack you can make use of `test.sh` script. This script runs tests against the stack and brings you back information and tells you what part of the document it's testing.
- quick overview of `test.sh`:
  - check networks 
  - check web server from client **(STEP 1 & 3)**
  - test bgp routes **(STEP 2)**
  - http flood test  **(STEP 5)**
  - cache purge **(STEP 5)**


### Manual Tests

- You need to check ELK stack and its results from the GUI.**(STEP 4)**

`Kibana` is accessible from [https://localhost:5601](https://localhost:5601) and filebeat dashboards are all added to it.

for the login credentials you can run:
~~~
grep "elastic" /root/DG-CDN-task/elk/passwords  | awk '{print $4,$5}'
~~~


After you've run `test.sh`, there should be logs of both `access` and `error` from the reverse proxy since you have attacked it with http flood script.
check out the logs on `Kibana` :

- **STEP 4:** check out Elastic different indicec: 

[https://localhost:5601/app/management/data/index_management/indices](https://localhost:5601/app/management/data/index_management/indices)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77579794/183501454-3a9fb944-3e6c-4f0d-9da8-3be9e28ca33f.png)


- **STEP 5:** On ELK side, create a retention mechanism to delete logs after X days/hours.

`This should've been an automated process using API but I'm out of time :)` so
click on the delete button

scroll down and set delete policy of your choice

- You can also access the web server through nginx(on port **80** which is proxied to the exposed 9090 port on the container): [http://localhost](http://localhost)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77579794/183503350-945c9198-840d-45d9-bffb-bd56d20d0688.png)



as these two were specifically mentioned in the document here's how to make use of them :

- **Cache Purge**
~~~
docker exec -it nginx_reverse_proxy sh -c '/cache_purger.sh < file name or url > < cache address in the nginx container (/cache in this case) > '
~~~

- **HTTP Flood**
~~~
docker exec -it client python3 pyflooder.py 172.25.2.2 80 1000
~~~

# Wrap up

### Know Issues

- If you encounter the following error, you could just ignore it.
~~~
Error: Failed to download metadata for repo 'appstream': Cannot prepare internal mirrorlist: No URLs in mirrorlist
~~~

- If encountered a connection error while pulling images or installing packages, Please consider checking your conncetion or trying a different `VPN` and just run the `setup.sh` script again.

### What to Ignore

- There are some other `README.md` and documents in this directroy which show a bit about what that directories doing, but they are not entirely true because of the changes made in this repo and not updating them after.


### Not Included Cases

The only part of the `Digikala CDN Team2020 â€“Ver 001Digikala Infrastructure -CDNTask Assignment` document i didn't work on, is STEP 5: tuning tcp stack.
which is because of being out of time :)


### Clean up

You can clean up your system with the `clean_up.sh` script. although you should notice that this will erase all your docker volumes, containers and images.
~~~
./clean_up
~~~
